# arduino

To install Arduino IDE on the Raspberry Pi the command:

sudo apt-get install arduino

can be used, however the version of the IDE installed as of 2016, is a very VERY old version.

To install a more recent one, say... perhaps you are interested in using the IDE to progrem the ESP8266, visit:

and take note of the "Linix Arm (experimental)" version, which as of 2016, is the 1.6.12 version:
